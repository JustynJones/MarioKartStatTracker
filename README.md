# Why I Made This
I originally decided to make this because I was playing Mario Kart online a lot and was interested in seeing what courses I do best at and what courses I need to work on. I also wanted to experiment with different Kart configurations and to see what works best. 

The other reason is because it had been some time since I had last done a personal project like this. I had missed doing projects like this and decided why not. This was also a project that lets me play with things that I don't really get to use a lot of in my current job. For example, the apps that I make at work don't use core data a lot so this was a project that lets me get more experience with it.
